# Steganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data, and in the context of digital images, it involves hiding information within image files without visibly altering the image. 


The project titled "Hiding Image in Steganography" addresses the following problem statement:
In today's digital landscape, the need for robust data security measures is more critical than ever. While conventional encryption methods play a vital role in securing information, they often fall short in protecting data at rest or during storage.
In light of  these challenges, my  project endeavors to explore and implement advanced steganography techniques to enhance data security.
The focus is on developing a steganography application that conceals textual data within image files, providing an extra layer of security beyond conventional encryption methods


This Project was Built as a Part of Cybersecurity Internship under VOIS and Edunet Foundation .
Below is the .py file along with the presentation 


Note : 
Open the file in VS code
Make Sure any 2 images are present one is the Original Image.jpg and One is Encrypted Image.png 
Encrytion here is only jpg -> png and not visa Versa to avoid errors

ENJOY :)
